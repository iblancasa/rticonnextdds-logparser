"""Log parsing functions for logs related to the network.

Functions:
  + on_parse_packet: it happens when an RTPS message is parsed.
  + on_udpv4_send: it happens when sending an RTPS packet via UDPv4.
  + on_udpv4_receive: it happens when receiving an RTPS packet via UDPv4.
  + on_shmem_send: it happens when sending an RTPS packet via ShareMemory.
  + on_shmem_receive: it happens when receiving an RTPS packet via ShareMemory.
  + on_error_unreachable_network: it happens when the network is unreachable.
  + on_error_no_transport_available: it happens when there isn't transport.
  + on_unregister_not_asserted_entity: it happens unregistering the entity.
  + on_schedule_data: it happens when a data is asynchronously scheduled.
  + on_send_data: it happens when a DATA message is sent.
  + on_resend_data: it happens when the writer resend a DATA message.

  + on_instance_not_found: it happens when the instance is not found.
  + on_send_from_deleted_writer: it happens when the writer is deleted.
  + on_fail_serialize: it happens when the serialization fails.
  + on_drop_unregister_no_ack_instance: it happens when there is missing ACK.

  + on_batch_serialize_failure: it happens when the batch serialization fails.
  + on_receive_data: it happens when the reader receives data.
  + on_receive_out_order_data: it happens when SequenceNumber isn't contiguous.
  + on_accept_data: it happens when the reader accepts data.
  + on_rejected_data: it happens when the reader rejects data.
  + on_receive_hb: it happens when receiving a HB.
  + on_send_ack: it happens when a ACK message is sent.
  + on_send_nack: it happens when a NACK message is sent.
  + on_sample_received_from_deleted_writer: it happens when no remote writer.
